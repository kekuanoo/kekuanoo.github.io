DALE: Comin’ out the gate...strong.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:58.000 
That’s my wife, Dale. The two of us 
live in Sammamish, Washington, 
about a 30 minute drive east of 
Seattle. We live in a one bedroom 
apartment, about 700 square feet 
worth of carpeted homeliness. We 
have a big canvas photo of the two 
of us hanging on our wall. It was 
taken at our wedding in Hawaii, 
where we’re both from. In the 
photo, Dale and I are in the center,
me in a Men’s Warehouse rental, 
black suit and coral tie and vest. 
Dale is in a beautiful wedding dress, 
not quite white but not pink or beige either.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:11.000 
DALE: Blush!

PERRY: It’s blush?

DALE: Yeah! (laughs)
